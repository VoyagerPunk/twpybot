coolkidscode typed : idk how to do that :(
phaqui typed : you're using the twitch api to request that info?
coolkidscode typed : yes
phaqui typed : isn't there a limit to how often you can pull that information?
coolkidscode typed : api.twitch.tv/kraken
coolkidscode typed : i can pull it every minute
coolkidscode typed : or faster
coolkidscode typed : but i think it updates the last follower every minute or so
coolkidscode typed : i'm not sure
coolkidscode typed : basically i want to send a message in chat when i get a new follower
coolkidscode typed : atm i'm using twitch alerts
coolkidscode typed : and i want to use twitch alerts and my own bot at the same time
phaqui typed : I'm not familiar with htat
phaqui typed : but I saw that there were requests to get followers, maximum 100 per time
coolkidscode typed : 100 followers?
phaqui typed : and to get the latest, they had a sort-key you could pass in
phaqui typed : so, sortby: created, and direction: asc
coolkidscode typed : ?/follows?limit=1
coolkidscode typed : i use this
coolkidscode typed : to get the last follower
phaqui typed : with maybe even limit set to how many of the latest you want to pull
phaqui typed : oh, yeah, could be direction: desc
phaqui typed : I always mix those up
